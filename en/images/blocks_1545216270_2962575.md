```blocks
when I start as a clone
go to x: (160) y: (160)
show
repeat (22) 
  change y by (-4)
end
repeat (170) 
  change x by (-2)
  turn ccw (6) degrees
end
repeat (30) 
  change y by (-4)
end
repeat (180) 
  change x by (2)
  turn cw (6) degrees
end
repeat (30) 
  change y by (-4)
end
repeat (170) 
  change x by (-2)
  turn ccw (6) degrees
end
delete this clone
